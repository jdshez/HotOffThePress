# Hot Off the Press a news blog React App

This app was built with React (using context for the user's login status and personal details along with hooks to load content) and MaterializeCSS. I used axios to call a news API for the content and implemented authentication with Auth0.  There's an added demo option for those who don't have time to sign in too.
