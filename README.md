# Hot Off the Press 

This is a news/mini-blog website where users search for the latest news stories in bite-size format. It's built with React (using context for the user's login status and personal details along with hooks to load content) and MaterializeCSS. I used axios to handle the API calls for the live content and implemented authentication with Auth0.  I've also included a demo option for those who don't wish to/don't have time to sign in. 
The site is live here:
