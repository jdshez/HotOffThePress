# Hot Off the Press 

Designed for users with minimal spare time, this is a news website that lets them search for the latest stories in a bite-size format. A simple search returns (up to) ten headlines that can be clicked taking the user to a page with an overview of the story, a link to the full article and details about the time, date of publishing.  \\
It's built with React (using context for the user's login status and personal details along with hooks to load live search results) and MaterializeCSS. I used axios to handle the API requests and implemented authentication with Auth0.  I've also included a demo option for those who don't wish to/don't have time to sign in. 
The site is live here: https://jdshez.github.io/HotOffThePress/
My aim was to get more familiar using contexts to store global data in React and thought that this would be a nice way to do it. I also thought it would be fun to play with Auth0 so I integrated this into the app. This was simple to do locally however I've had some issues with it on the live site. I had intended to do a demo login through Auth0, however due to this as yet unresolved problem, I decided to use a 'Demo' button on the nav bar. As the focus of the project was React I felt this was an adequate work around that allowed me to get the site up for the time being. I will persist in finding a solution nonetheless :)
